The central focus of this project entailed the conceptualization
and development of an application geared towards easing the
workflow for biologists possessing a scientific foundation in
RNA-Seq analyses but exhibiting limited or no proficiency in
programming.
This application is characterized by a user-friendly
graphical interface that facilitates a seamless user experience.
Within this interface, users are enabled to upload pertinent
files, subsequently triggering a series of analytical procedures
tailored for the examination of data derived from RNA-Seq
experiments. These sequential analytical steps encompass the
trimming of raw sequences originating from RNA-Seq
experiments, alignment to the reference genome,
quantification of sequences with subsequent conversion to
gene expression levels, differential expression analysis, and
gene set enrichment analysis.
The outcomes of these meticulous analyses are formatted to
meet publication standards and are conveniently accessible to
users through the graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally,
users are afforded the option to download these results in
diverse file formats, including .csv, .pdf, .png, among others.
It is imperative to note that all the aforementioned processes
and analyses are meticulously executed within the R
programming language, utilizing established packages widely
recognized and endorsed by the research community.
